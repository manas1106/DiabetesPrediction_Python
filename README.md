-> Abstract:

Diabetes is a chronic disease characterized by high blood glucose levels. Early detection and intervention are crucial for managing diabetes and preventing severe health complications. This project explores the use of machine learning techniques, specifically Support Vector Machines (SVM), to predict the onset of diabetes based on the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset.

**Keywords:** Diabetes prediction, Machine Learning, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset

-> Introduction:

Diabetes is a global health concern affecting millions of people worldwide. Early diagnosis and effective treatment can significantly improve quality of life and prevent complications. This project investigates the application of machine learning algorithms in predicting diabetes risk.

-> Methodology:

1. Data Acquisition: The Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset is used in this project, containing various patient attributes like blood glucose levels, blood pressure, and age.
2. Data Preprocessing: Data cleaning techniques are employed to handle missing values and ensure data quality.
3. Feature Engineering: (Optional) If necessary, feature engineering can be applied to create new features from existing ones or transform features for better model performance.
4. Model Selection and Training: Support Vector Machines (SVM) are chosen due to their effectiveness in classification tasks. The model is trained on the prepared dataset.
5. Model Evaluation: The trained SVM model is evaluated on a held-out test set to assess its accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and other relevant metrics.

-> Results:

The project achieves an accuracy of approximately 77% in predicting diabetes using SVM. This demonstrates the potential of machine learning for early diabetes detection.

-> Conclusion:

This project successfully implements Support Vector Machines for diabetes prediction. The results highlight the potential of machine learning as a valuable tool for healthcare professionals in identifying individuals at risk of developing diabetes.
